Object level lock / Method level Synchronization
--------------------------------------------------
you can use method level synchronization or synchronization block then you have to pass "this" keyword or object,
only one thread will allow to enter into block or method and data will be in consistent state.

But

multiple threads are operate on multiple instances then object level lock won't work because object level lock will be 
applicable for single object , it can't control it if it's having multiple objects and multiple threads are operating 
multiple instances then you have to use static method synchronization method or class level lock synchronization bloack.


Class level Lock / Static level Synchronization
-------------------------------------------------
if you want to keep the data consistent by multiple threads are operated by the multiple instances/objects then 
you have to use  static synchronization method or synchronization block with class level object.
